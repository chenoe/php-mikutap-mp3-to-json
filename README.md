The design is based on PHP and can convert existing MP3 files on server into JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) files that can be used by MikuTap.

The PHP scripts include what name the JSON file will be(the output path can be customized), where the raw files exist, and the number of raw files(NOT recommend changing).

The "main" library, which includes sounds of keys to be played, needs 32 MP3 files, while the "track" library, which includes background sounds, needs 11 MP3 files.

The raw files are supposed to be named from 1.mp3 to 32.mp3 (for "main") or 11.mp3 (for "track").
